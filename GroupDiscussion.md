#GroupDiscussion2 week8

1)Movie's popularity index

We tried to add number of raters for each movie. It can be viewed as an index of movies' popularity. Apparently, there is pointless to compare the rater number of movies which released in 1994 with the rater number of movies which released in 1964. So, the released year of movies is also included to normalize movies' popularity.

Define distance function for each variable (age, gender, occupation, zip-code) and use weighted average to combine them to measure the dissimilarity between any two users. Will implement the distance function in R.
